We are developing a patient-centric, privacy-preserving, cloud-based, biometric identification system for electronic health records which enables users to securely store and retrieve their confidential EHR on untrusted public clouds.

In any secure information system there are always three primary, and sometime competing, requirements, confidentiality, integrity and availability. At times, improving on one aspect is at the detriment of another aspect, and in many cases, availability has suffered as confidentiality and integrity of information have taken the forefront. 

The ever increasing popularity of cloud-based storage systems in the past years, has aided in the drive for better availability, but has come with major issues related to the protection of confidential information stored on those systems. Reliance on individual cloud-storage systems to provide confidentiality and integrity of information has resulted in a diverse and ultimately untenable solutions.
